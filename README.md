**⚠️ Educational Purpose**  
This web-based OS simulation demonstrates retro-futuristic interface concepts. Not a real operating system.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Advanced browser-based simulation of a operating system with dual boot capabilities and multiple interface modes [retro - linux]. Designed for web developers and UI/UX enthusiasts to study alternative interface paradigms.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
✔️ Explore retro-futuristic UI design principles  
✔️ Understand web-based OS simulation techniques  
✔️ Learn about browser animation capabilities  
✔️ Implement responsive interface elements  
✔️ Analyze simulated system monitoring approaches  
✔️ Develop alternative navigation paradigms  

## 🚀 Features

- **Dual Boot System**: Choose between CR42 OS and Linux environments
- **Multiple Boot Modes**:
  - Normal Boot
  - Safe Mode
  - Debug Mode
  - Recovery Console
- **Realistic Boot Sequence** with simulated system messages
- **System Resource Monitoring** (simulated CPU, memory, disk, and temperature)
- **Two Distinct UI Styles**:
  - Retro terminal interface
  - Modern animated boot screen
- **Interactive Elements** with keyboard and mouse support
- **Responsive Design** that works on different screen sizes

### 🖥️ CR42 OS UI

#### 🐧 CR42 v0.42.2 — Linux Interface
A terminal-centric design inspired by modern Linux distributions.

- **Applications**:
  - 📁 **File Manager** – Navigate a simulated file system  
  - 💻 **Terminal** – Interactive command-line interface  
  - 🔍 **Web Browser** – Firefox-style with functional Google search  
  - ⚙️ **System Settings** – Customize appearance and behavior  
  - 🔒 **Lock Screen** – Password-protected access ("linux" is the default)  

### 🧭 Basic Interactions

- **Double-click** icons to launch applications  
- **Right-click** the desktop to open context menus  
- **Drag** windows by their title bars  
- Use **panel icons** for quick access to common features  

## 🌟 Special Features

- 💬 **Real-time Terminal**: Supports common Linux commands  
  - Try: `ls`, `mkdir`, `sudo`, `neofetch`, and more  
- 📊 **System Monitoring**: Simulated CPU, memory, disk, and temperature stats  
- 🖼️ **Wallpaper Customization**: Choose from presets or upload your own  
- 🔒 **Lock Screen Password**: Default is `"linux"`  
- 🌐 **Browser Simulation**: Functional Google search via simulated browser  
> 💡 **Tip**: Type `neofetch` in the terminal for cool system info output!
