**⚠️ Educational Purpose**  
This web-based OS simulation demonstrates retro-futuristic interface concepts. Not a real operating system.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Advanced browser-based simulation of a operating system with dual boot capabilities and multiple interface modes [retro - linux]. Designed for web developers and UI/UX enthusiasts to study alternative interface paradigms.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
✔️ Explore retro-futuristic UI design principles  
✔️ Understand web-based OS simulation techniques  
✔️ Learn about browser animation capabilities  
✔️ Implement responsive interface elements  
✔️ Analyze simulated system monitoring approaches  
✔️ Develop alternative navigation paradigms
